## üîê Step 1: Create Auth User (Manual)

**You need to do this step manually in Supabase Dashboard:**

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users**  
3. Click **"Add user"** ‚Üí **"Create new user"**
4. Enter:
   - **Email**: `tom+aireport@missionmutual.org`
   - **Password**: `TomReport123!` (or your choice)
   - ‚úÖ Check **"Auto confirm email"**
5. Click **"Create user"**
6. **Copy the User ID** (looks like: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`)

## üîó Step 2: Link User to Organization (Automatic)

**Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor** (replace `YOUR_AUTH_USER_ID` with the actual ID from Step 1):

```sql
-- Link tom+aireport@missionmutual.org to unfoldingWord
INSERT INTO users (
    id,
    organization_id,
    role,
    full_name,
    created_at,
    updated_at
) VALUES (
    'YOUR_AUTH_USER_ID'::uuid, -- Replace with actual auth user ID
    '021c6409-1a1b-44b9-81a5-4cca7f0ee033'::uuid, -- unfoldingWord org ID
    'org_user', -- Regular organization user role
    'Tom (AI Report Test)',
    NOW(),
    NOW()
) ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
    organization_id = EXCLUDED.organization_id,
    role = EXCLUDED.role,
    full_name = EXCLUDED.full_name,
    updated_at = NOW();

-- Verify the setup
SELECT 
    u.full_name as user_name,
    u.role,
    o.name as organization_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT a.id) as total_applications,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ar.id) as total_reports,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ar.status = 'not_started' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as not_started_reports,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ar.status = 'draft' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as draft_reports,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ar.status = 'submitted' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as submitted_reports
FROM users u
JOIN eten_organizations o ON u.organization_id = o.id
LEFT JOIN eten_applications a ON o.id = a.organization_id
LEFT JOIN eten_application_reports ar ON a.id = ar.application_id 
    AND ar.reporting_period_start = '2025-01-01' 
    AND ar.reporting_period_end = '2025-06-30'
WHERE u.id = 'YOUR_AUTH_USER_ID'::uuid
GROUP BY u.id, u.full_name, u.role, o.name;
```
