In 2025, we will continue to develop our specialized services for the collective benefit of ETEN partners and All Access Goals.

The IW makes it possible for Deaf stakeholders to communicate in their primary sign language and cultural identity. This communication is essential for bringing unique Deaf perspectives and skills to all aspects of AAG progress in sign languages: community mobilization, project management, training, translation activities, technology development, innovation, quality assurance, and distribution.

Through its work, the IW catalyzes relationships between international Deaf partners and US-based organizations. As a result, Deaf partners interact and collaborate within the global Bible translation movement and take greater ownership of AAGs. At the same time, hearing partners gain insight into Deaf strengths and challenges.

Today’s IW is the largest and most diverse to date. We have 43 professional interpreters, up from 28 last year; 18 of them bring skills in 10 signed and spoken languages other than ASL and English. For 2025 we look forward to greater leverage of the language access tools they serve in the Deaf Bible translation toolbelt.
We celebrate how the IW is part of God's work to raise up Deaf partners and change the trajectory of Bible access in their sign language communities.","The IW meets a need for sign language interpreters who are informed, trained, and mission-driven to accelerate Deaf Bible translation. 

The IW enables centralized stewardship of funding and expertise by streamlining and strengthening processes that benefit ETEN partners. Apart from the IW, no single Deaf-centric or Bible translation organization is likely to realize the full, direct benefit of investing in a specialized interpreter program. 

Through its positioning within Deaf Bible Society (DBS), the IW operates in close leadership alignment with ETEN Steering Committee priorities. IW positioning and visibility are relevant to professional interpreter networks and to the growing global awareness of sign language Bible translation opportunities for Deaf communities. Engagement of diverse interpreters and Deaf communities is essential to accelerate AAG progress by all ETEN partners participating in sign language Bible translation.

IW positioning within DBS still requires work to gain traction and trust. In prior years, partner organizations perceived DBS as a competitor and, therefore, hesitated to use the IW, despite the code of conduct for professional interpreters to serve with neutrality and confidentiality. We have been overwhelmed to see a miracle trust unfold as the generosity of hours was made available, once hesitant partners are receiving the general benefit of the IW’s contribution to momentum in communication, training, tools, and interpretation.","As a central resource accessible to ETEN partners, the IW offers fractional access to highly informed, trained interpreters who are Bible translation allies. The IW also promotes specialized knowledge among interpreters to elevate the quality of work they can deliver.

The solution provided by the IW entails:

Workforce recruiting, contracting, onboarding, and compensation management
Annual verification of credientials for associate and certified members of the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID)
Professional training by video and in person to integrate principles and practices of Bible translation; training includes accredited content that applies to Continuing Education Units for interpreter certifications
Interpreters knowledgeable of the Bible translation movement and associated partners/organizations
Interpretation in American Sign Language, International Sign, and other languages; plus a global network of interpreters
Online request and scheduling system
Central point of contact for events that require multiple interpreters and/or languages
Assurance of interpreter quality standards and feedback when improvement is needed

This means that 17 percent of all sign language Scripture accessible today was added during the past year! We contend the likelihood of less progress without the IW alongside.
The IW adds catalytic value through:
Administrative capacity: Leaders collaborate and make decisions across the Bible translation movement. Language access connections are essential to building trust, sharing information, generating ideas, reducing duplicate efforts, and solving problems. 
Project development: Clear communication supports leaders in effectively stewarding their commitments. Specialized interpreters are vital to productive collaboration across language and cultural boundaries.
Training for translation teams: In any interpretive situation, context, and clarity are essential, never more so than when God’s Word is the primary focus and ultimate deliverable. The IW supports open access to training resources previously accessible only to literate people. Fund Development and Stewardship: Collaborative work includes funding discussions among Deaf and hearing partners. In these discussions, Deaf leaders gain access to funding strategies and ROI considerations that are well-known to hearing leaders and expected by investors to build capacity among Deaf leaders and strengthen partnerships. The top-performing translation efforts have a direct correlation to an interprete","In 2024, we decreased IW dependence on ETEN funding in a few ways. We note both positive and negative effects:

Cost-sharing: We supplemented ETEN funding by establishing criteria that require financial participation from the organizations using IW services. Cost-sharing covers some of the hourly fees for interpreters, not the core IW program. This has been generally well received and will continue in 2025. Some organizations hire interpreters independently; however, they often hire interpreters trained by the IW.
Capacity Refocus: We reduced our grant-funded interpreting capacity to 1,010 service hours, down from 1,500+ hours served in 2023. As of June 2024, we are halfway through the year and have used two thirds of the grant-funded hours.
Compensation Management: We implemented a 1-hour minimum for contracted interpreting assignments vs. the typical 2-hour minimum. This has reduced costs for shorter meetings. Meanwhile, even as have developed a larger interpreter pool, many interpreters prioritize higher-earning opportunities where 2-hour minimums are standard. Consequently, we have had to decline 8 requests for interpreters so far this year due to a lack of availability.

IW funding through ETEN is redistributed in services to all participating partners. Given the collective benefit, ETEN remains a key funding source for the core program development to serve the Bible translation movement overall.",7012G0000012NYJQA2,Capacity Building - Organizational Development

To meet the All Access Goals, an estimated 10,000 translators and 2,000 consultants are needed. By equipping mother tongue speakers to translate directly from original languages, Whole Word Institute accelerates the process, empowers communities, and reduces costs.

Whole Word Institute plays a crucial role in building biblical source language capacity for the Bible Translation movement, offering training and tools that accelerate access to the entire Bible in all languages, whether written, oral, or signed. For nearly a decade, Whole Word has enabled mother tongue translators and consultants worldwide to gain proficiency in Biblical Hebrew, partnering with over 60 BT agencies and church-led initiatives across 50 nations on 4 continents. In just 9 months, Whole Word equips students with the skills needed to translate directly from the Hebrew Bible, making the Old Testament (71% of the full Bible) accessible without using a gateway language.

The Hebrew Extension Learning Program (HELP) has proven effective for distance learning, breaking down barriers to original language training. Whole Word's collaborative initiative aims to further develop local competencies, empowering community-led translation projects and enhancing the global Church's ability to fulfill its Bible translation mission.","As indigenous communities are passionate to see their people transformed by God’s whole Word in their heart language, the local Church is at the forefront of the mission to end Bible poverty. Western agencies cannot achieve their mission without these local partners. There is increasingly growing demand from local church networks and translation entities to receive training in the original biblical languages so that they can translate Scripture directly from the source. This has been expressed by our partners on the ground as a need for field-based training that maximizes the accessibility, speed and reproducibility of the training for local workers. 
In response, Whole Word has developed a locally operated hybrid Biblical Hebrew program that equips local partners to develop and sustain their own Biblical Hebrew training programs. Our program amplifies the local Church’s capacity not only to learn to translate the Old Testament directly from the source, but to take ownership of training other translators. This multiplies the number of direct Scripture translation projects that can start and be self-maintained within their own language communities.","Whole Word's hybrid Hebrew learning hubs use the accredited HELP curriculum, combining in-person classes led by local partners with specialized online courses. This approach maintains high language education standards while fostering community learning in local contexts. Many partners, such as a large church network in Indonesia, have individuals ready for training to start local translation projects, with some already covering 50% of training costs. Whole Word collaborates with local Bible translation agencies to ensure high-quality training while keeping the responsibility for translation projects with mother tongue speakers. The locally operated Hebrew learning hubs are guided by principles such as translating directly from original languages for faster, cheaper, and better translations, empowering indigenous churches to be self-reliant in translation and Scripture resources. This approach also equips communities to develop their own biblical resources, supporting long-term discipleship and spiritual growth. In 2024, Whole Word partnered with Wycliffe USA and South Africa to launch Hebrew learning hubs in Ethiopia and Mozambique, with additional hubs in Benin and Indonesia. Each hub aims to become self-sustained within seven years, with Whole Word providing training, development support, instructors, curriculum content, and accreditation assistance. In 2025, Whole Word plans to sustain these hubs and launch three new ones, further supporting the global Church's BT mission.","To our knowledge, we are the only major organization within the BT Movement to provide field-based Biblical Hebrew training, specifically with the goal of equipping local teams to become self-sustaining. This innovative initiative has been developed at the specific request of partners and seeks to strengthen the capacities and build the organizational health of local Bible translation organizations and local ministries around the globe.","This project addresses the workforce needs required by the BT Movement for achieving the 2033 translation goals by directly responding to the appetite for source language training expressed by the global Church. On average every fourth verse of the New Testament (NT) is a direct quote, illusion or reference to the Old Testament (OT); the NT cannot be fully understood without the context of the Old. By investing in the original language capacity of the local workforce, Whole Word is enabling new translations of the Old Testament to begin more rapidly and be completed more accurately than using a gateway language. Further, as the increased use of AI tools enables the BT movement to accelerate progress in new languages, sufficient mother tongue translators competent in the biblical source languages will be vital for ensuring that this progress is not stunted by a lack of personnel equipped to accurately check and refine translations.","Depending on the local implementing partner, developing each hub in the early stages may entail a greater “ownership” on the part of Whole Word and/or BT agency partners with this involvement and funding decreasing over time. In each instance, Whole Word serves the local church/entity in establishing its self-operated language training program over a period of up to 7 years (or fewer). At the end of the agreed period, the expectation is that the hub will become entirely self-funded. In 2025 specifically, we expect local church partners to contribute according to their means (estimated to range from 10 to 50% of total costs), topped up by gifts from generous donors.  
This project is currently still a new development for Whole Word, which is why our funding request to ETEN is at 45% of the budget for the 7 hubs in 2025 (i.e. 4 in year 2 and 3 new hubs). As the initiative develops, the percentage of our budget requested will decrease. As this project gains momentum and with our increased fundraising and marketing investment over the next three years, we aim to engage prospective donors in the US, Europe, and Asia. They will have the opportunity to sponsor or seed-fund a training hub in a specific area for a set period.",7012G0000012NYJQA2,Capacity Building - Organizational Development

Humble approach to their recommendations., ,18.0,18.0,"Seed Company’s organizational development effort is in alignment with our historic ministry posture of building capacity in local Bible translation partners to take increasing shares of responsibility in Bible translation. 
Our organizational development effort aims to support translation organizations in creating the best possible roadmap for change. We create better alignment between individual parts in an organization, explore new linkages to external partners within their own natural networks, initiate new leadership development - changing overall leadership style thereby changing the organizational culture, which in our experience prepares organizations for intense growth. 
There are two phases in every systemic consulting experience for organizations:
1 – A systemic scan launches each organizational consulting effort. The main goal of this phase is to gain insights: understanding the current state of functioning, the prevailing organizational patterns, identifying challenges and organizational potential for change. 
2 – Systemic interventions last a few years and may be a combination of various types of activities. Each plan for change is completely tailor-made for individual organizations, embedded in the insights gathered in the scanning phase.
The results of our efforts since 2014 have been to radically broaden involvement of national investors in supporting local Scripture translation efforts and of national organizations in regional cooperative leadership.","Capacity building has underpinned Bible translation for decades. Much money, time and energy has been invested in equipping individuals for leadership in national translation organizations. However, in our experience such investment has been inadequate to catalyze systemic change in national translation organizations that will have an acceleration influence and lasting results.","Systemic organizational development consulting brings about lasting change within organizations which traditional ways of learning and capacity building have not been able to deliver because it includes the following:

• Scan and assessment of a client organization that is thorough and comprehensive to understand their:
      o Vision or aspirational impact
      o Current function of systems capabilities
      o Linkages to external partners within their own natural networks
      o Organizational culture
      o Challenges for change
      o Potential for change

• Systemic Interventions: tailor-made plans of intervention for each organization guided by expert consultants to create better alignment between activities and the organization’s vision coupled with mentoring of visionary leadership. These interventions include training, coaching, mentoring, facilitating, introduction of new methods, tools, and/or business models, etc.

• Strategic Funding that rewards performance in achieving milestones toward organizational transformation:
    o Growth Funding is provided to enable the partner organization to make necessary changes toward their preferred future.
    o Performance Funding connected to resource mobilization is provided based on their success in fundraising.
    o Performance Funding connected to Bible translation is provided based on their success in launching and sustaining Bible translation projects.","We are aware of Wycliffe Bible Translator USA's Organizational Strengthening Initiative and SIL’s Organizational Development Initiative, but neither of these projects are really similar to this proposal.","Since October 2021, translation organizations participating in our organizational transformation program self-report having taken the lead in launching translation efforts in 443 languages. Through our Performance Funding connected to Bible translation, Seed Company has incentivized sustainable funding in 203 of those languages by providing between 26% and 49% of funding needs. This subset of languages have all gone through additional layers of verification by Seed Company to ensure quality translation is taking place. Of these languages: 188 languages are on the AAG list, and 92 are working toward achieving an AAG. The AAG breakdown for these languages is: 14 languages have a remaining goal of 25 chapters or less, 61 languages are working on the New Testament goal, and 17 are working on the full Bible goal. These translation projects are also on pace to complete their AAG before 2033.","Traditionally, the large amount of cash required for translation projects has made national partners dependent upon grants from international sponsoring agencies. Throughout their organizational transformation journey each partner organization explores new linkages to external partners within their own natural networks and discovers buried assets that are already in place in their contexts. Activating these assets decreases the cash demand required for translation projects. In addition to discovering buried assets, Seed Company’s organizational consultants coach each partner on relational resource mobilization.
Performance funding, whether connected to resource mobilization or starting and sustaining translation projects, is only available when the partner organization secures their responsibility from non-ETEN implementing organizations, thereby radically broadening involvement of gospel patrons from around the world. In 2025 we estimate that the client organizations involved in raising money for translation through performance funding will raise in excess of $4,000,000 from their own network of donors.",7012G0000012NYJQA2,Capacity Building - Organizational Development

Cross-cultural barriers, most indigenous languages are oral with very few literacy resources 
Low literacy levels among Mother Tongue Translators, particularly in the vernacular","In 2025 we will continue to apply the best in OD & add new translation tech & translator expertise to the Bible translation.
BSO is not transactional but seeks to increase learning from one another & to work more purposefully together to address the needs of our nations.
BSOs approach has stimulated increased coordination with & between other Bible Translation & Engagement agencies in the region, through South Pacific Bible Forums (SPBF) from which was born National Collaborations.

The Vanuatu AVTT pilot will be a true pilot. All learnings, good & bad, will be recorded & shared openly with BSO & SPBF. The intention is to build a successful model for use by BSO & other agencies.
The experience of BSSP with the BSO Alliance will be reviewed by Growth Partners (TSC) in 2024, with a view to building up BSSP in the service of translation across Oceania. 
We are confident that a well-funded, professionally coordinated investment in the core operations of the Bible Societies Oceania will result in an increase in the number & productivity of Bible Translation projects & the associated Bible engagement projects.
BSO has undertaken negotiations with Faith Comes By Hearing & ABS to pilot an End2End project in Vanuatu with AAGs.
BSO will continue to play a resourcing & facilitation role in the annual South Pacific Bible Forum & the establishment of National Collaboration Groups.

Let's talk about being more prescriptive this year regarding how much of the $3.5m should be designated for ""Translation"" vs. ""Capacity Building / Tools""",32.0,32.0,"The OBT Table in 2025 is to catalyze sustainability. This objective is centered on promoting healthy models of OBT to expand the reach and impact of OBT projects globally in a manner that is both scalable and sustainable over the long-term. It involves facilitating an environment where new and existing OBT projects can not only succeed but also multiply, eventually leading to an exponential increase in the number of Bible translations being completed, and an increase of communities and people engaging with Scripture. 

To achieve this, the OBT Table will focus on three supporting objectives: 1) Advocate for ongoing initiatives to foster sustainability of the movement 2) Improve the way we report, manage, and use data; and 3) Build capacity through training and stewardship of tools, finances, and exegetical resources.","The intent is not merely to add more projects, but to create powerful and replicable models for Bible translation that pull new partners into OBT and are adaptable to diverse contexts to sustain the momentum towards the All-Access Goals. In order to sustain OBT projects that have already started, there is an ongoing need for multi-year financial models that scale.","The OBT Table in 2025 is poised to catalyze sustainability in the field of Bible translation by fostering robust models that enhance the global reach and long-term impact of these projects. The initiative is designed to create an environment where new and existing Oral Bible Translation (OBT) projects can thrive and multiply, leading to a significant increase in completed Bible translations and broader community engagement with Scripture. To achieve these ambitious goals, the OBT Table will focus on three key supporting objectives: advocating for ongoing initiatives that bolster the sustainability of the movement, enhancing the reporting, management, and utilization of data, and building capacity through comprehensive training and responsible stewardship of tools, finances, and exegetical resources. This approach aims to ensure that the momentum of OBT projects not only continues but also grows exponentially, enabling more communities around the world to access and engage with the Bible in their own languages.",,"The Oral Bible Translation (OBT) Affinity Table is playing a pivotal role in driving a movement that is significantly advancing the global effort to accomplish Bible translation. As of 2024, there are nearly 1,000 active Bible translation projects underway, a testament to the momentum and influence of this initiative. The OBT Affinity Table has been instrumental in closing the gap in Bible translation by fostering collaboration, innovation, and sustainability among translation teams and organizations. Its strategic focus on scaling efforts through effective models, data management, and capacity building has empowered more communities to engage with Scripture in their own languages. By creating a supportive and resource-rich environment, the OBT Affinity Table is not only accelerating the pace of Bible translations but also ensuring that these projects are sustainable and capable of reaching even the most remote and underserved linguistic communities.","The Oral Bible Translation (OBT) Affinity is strategically planning to decrease its dependency on external funding by cultivating stronger partnerships with a diverse range of donors and by empowering local leadership. By expanding its network of supporters, the OBT Affinity aims to create a more resilient and diversified funding base, reducing the reliance on any single source of financial support. Additionally, the focus on empowering local leadership is critical; by equipping local communities with the tools, training, and resources needed to take ownership of translation projects, the OBT Affinity is fostering self-sufficiency and sustainability. As local leaders gain the capacity to manage and lead these efforts independently, the need for external financial support will diminish, allowing the movement to thrive with greater autonomy and local investment. This dual approach not only ensures the long-term viability of OBT projects but also strengthens the overall impact of the Bible translation movement.",7012G0000012NYJQA2,Capacity Building - Organizational Development

In May 2021, the Sign Language (55 Table) Workgroup under ETEN was established.  What began with 5 sign language organizations has expanded to 14, with focus on the following 8 priorities:
Collaboration
Mutual understanding
Improved quality and access to sign language information and translation progress
Alignment of priorities and strategic planning with All Access Goals
Improved Communication
Sign language translation acceleration
Avoiding duplication
Prayer multiplication

Building on significant progress of the past three years, the 55 Table views CY2025 as an opportunity to build on collaboration, productivity and unity to prayerfully advance the following strategic initiatives:
Ongoing survey work in China
Continue tracking progress in Tiers 1, 2, and 3 sign languages and integrate sign language data with Progress.Bible.
Continue data collection related to translation pace in key Tier 1 and Tier 2 sign languages and invite local project teams to brainstorm and discuss ideas to accelerate that pace.
Encourage centralized locations for sign language translation resources for easy access by local teams and international partners; and
Ongoing Deaf culture and sign language training for hearing allies.

Progress in these areas will have a direct impact on reducing the list of remaining languages not started, as well as increase the pace of translation.","Up until 2021, sign language Bible translation (SLBT) organizations did not have a dedicated space for collaboration, partnership, and alignment on shared goals.  At the time, many SLBT organizations were not aware of the All-Access Goals.

This has changed significantly over the last three years, thanks to the generous support of ETEN and the involvement of SLBT partner organizations. Specifically, there has been substantial improvement in shared information, coordinated effort, and collaborative networking within the SLBT space. We are incredibly grateful for ETEN taking a chance by patiently supporting these efforts.

Areas of particular need to be addressed in the CY2025 period include:
Continuing to improve data about sign languages in China through language survey work.
Assessing the current pace of sign language projects already in progress and creating spaces for translation teams to come together to recognize the pace issue, build support networks, and innovate better solutions.
Providing Deaf leaders space and opportunities in which they can work on innovation and emerging translation models with Deaf and hearing ministry partners.
Centralized access for various resources that have been identified by the 55 Table’s Tools and Training Workgroup.
Bridging the gap between hearing and Deaf colleagues in the ETEN space through Deaf culture and sign language training.","For the CY2025 period, the 55 Table will prayerfully work to see more progress in the following strategic areas (in alignment with the 55 Table’s eight priorities and ETEN’s All Access Goals):

Language List - Survey work in China will improve sign language list data available to Progress.Bible.  30+ of the currently listed full Bible and New Testament equivalent AAG languages remain under-researched.  The Data workgroup will emphasize collaboration and experimentation with emerging methodologies to accelerate research for these languages. Additionally, we will emphasize training new researchers to increase overall capacity in the movement.  Research largest remaining AAGs with insufficient information (China, India, others as capacity allows).  Increase research capacity within the movement by providing field training opportunities as part of projects
All Access Goals and Acceleration of Translation - Pace data gathering, workgroups increasing collaboration/communication/information sharing, various areas of training, identifying/sharing resources will help partners and local teams become more focused on AAGs as well as increase acceleration and quality of sign language Bible translations.
Improve Deaf and Hearing Dynamics - Facilitate training to enhance communication and interaction between hearing and Deaf.  The training we provide in 2025 will build on the momentum and success of CY2023 and CY2024’s Deaf culture training for hearing implementing partners.","The 55 Table holds a wide scope of participation and collaboration of significant organizations in the Sign Language Bible Translation (SLBT) movement, including some who are ETEN Implementing Partners:_x000D_

IllumiNations 12VC launched in March 2021. Over 76,000 people have given to the movement, with over 51,000 of them taking the challenge by donating $35 per month (the recognized cost of translating a single verse of Scripture).

Yet today, for approximately 1,000 languages and the millions of people who speak them, there’s not even one verse of the Bible translated for them that speaks to their hearts. Therefore, the need for Bible translation is critical for the global church to grow. To help solve this problem, there is a movement-wide need for massive giver mobilization supporting Bible translation. The illumiNations movement has seen exceeding generosity through its illumiNations major donor gatherings. But there was a desire for a giving community comprised of thousands of Christians around the globe coming together to give what they have to the movement. Now moving into its fourth year of ministry, the illumiNations 12VC has provided that platform to unite and efficiently use every gift – from small one-time gift to the $35 a month sacrifice – so that all people will come to the light through His Word!","The illumiNations 12VC project raises awareness to the global urgent need of Bible translation through live events, national music tours, online and virtual campaigns, and grassroots activities in strategic Christian communities. Across these initiatives, 12VC has continued to average an 8.5% response rate for acquiring new donors—more than twice industry averages. Additionally, we are seeing the encouraging expansion of this campaign into Church Mobilization channels, including pilots to leverage this campaign for their Church fundraising initiatives with the first of our ETEN Implementing Partners (Wycliffe Bible Translators). Also new this year, 12VC went deeper with a number of our illumiNations Champions, to directly leverage their audiences for engagement within the work of this campaign. Leaders like Louie Giglio, Sadie Robertson-Huff and Jennie Allen top a list of influential leaders, leveraging a range of their influence channels for donor acquisition. We celebrate the progress of the program and this growing community of givers answering the call to the need of Bible translation. In total, over $30 million will have been received and shared collectively among the implementing partners by the end of 2024.",No.,"This project provides an expansive new revenue stream to raise awareness, engage the church, and help resource the completion of the AAGs. The trajectory of illumiNations 12VC donors over the course of the next three years (2025 – 2027) is on track to generate over $65 million toward our shared mission of eradicating Bible poverty.  From the beginning, this campaign was designed to bring the invitation of illumiNations to everyone.  Across 2024, the 12VC campaign will be shared with over 1 million people.","The goal is to move illumiNations 12VC program to a stronger annual ROI every year of progression. This has happened each year since 2021 and is on track to continue the upward trend. This includes important increases in the ROI associated with this campaign. As the number of people involved in the illumiNations 12VC movement continues to grow year over year, the added revenue also increases. In 2025 and beyond, we expect to get to 2:1 ROI and push toward 3:1 by 2027. For this, we have four directions in place for 12VC to become more sustainable: (1) Leveraging the good investments for a strengthened 12VC illumiNations brand and data integration, including its seamless integration with the larger illumiNations messaging and community.  (2) Strengthening donor cultivation with the embedding of our lead 12VC Influencers more extensively into our digital cultivation communities;  (3) Leveraging the good learnings from church mobilization acquisition in 2025, to deepen ETEN Implementing Partner engagement and reduce acquisition costs. (n.b., the cost to acquire one giver via a church is around half the cost of our typical artist partnership).

The partnerships with iLab, BiblioNexus, and the Aquifer are critical for providing the movements with the translation tools they need. Access to these tools on mobile devices (like smart phones and tablets)  is imperative. A fundamental aspect of our approach involves seeking collaboration with organizations and networks that are engaged in similar translation endeavors.

This is a deeply integrated approach to Bible translation allowing local churches/movements to produce the Bible in both oral or written formats according to their unique needs. One of our primary partners in this project is the 24:14 Network. The 24:14 macro network is committed “to engage every unreached people and place with an effective kingdom movement strategy by December 31, 2025” and includes about 9 million churches worldwide, predominantly in Africa and Asia. The DMM/CPM networks that comprise 24:14 are held together by relationships and a common vision. By definition, 24:14 considers a movement to be established when the churches in the movement have reproduced four generations of churches. This is a collaborative project that establishes national church/movement leaders with the following: multimodal processes for equipping minority language Bible translation teams with best practices, quality assurance checking within their church/leadership communities, comprehensive translation guides to answer difficult Bible translation questions, innovative open-source software (making the Bible translation process much faster), and open-licensed biblical content, breaking the copyright barrier to source texts.","Thousands of minority language groups around the world still do not have Scripture in their mother tongue, significantly hindering evangelism, discipleship, and the establishment of healthy churches. Many of these are precisely where these large-scale DMMs and CPMs are seeking to work. The remaining languages tend to be in areas hostile to the gospel where multiple barriers exist and traditional translators would have greatly restricted access. Other challenges to both translation and disciple-making include the following: governmental opposition to the use of minority languages for the sake of national unity; copyright restrictions preventing local translation teams from accessing needed resources; existing translations that are significantly out of date or otherwise unusable; deep cultural suspicion of outsiders; geographic isolation, etc. With these barriers and other contextual realities in mind, we must radically broaden the workforce and fully engage global church networks in order to meet the 2033 All Access Goals (AAG) and Every Verse Current (EVC) goals.","To facilitate a rapidly reproducing translation workforce, our strategy is to integrate multimodal Bible translation training into existing church-planting movements. Because DMMs and CPMs already operate with expansion and multiplication in mind, we are seeking to integrate Bible translation into their existing training patterns. Our strategy provides Bible translation training, resources, and support that empowers these movements to achieve trustworthy and trusted translations.

The Bible Aquifer has begun the process of providing helpful resources for these movements. In 2024, we tested the Bible Well app, which draws from the Aquifer, in the training process with movement leaders and it was received with great enthusiasm. Movement leaders are asking for more and as quickly as possible. We are collaborating with iLab to continue uploading resources in Arabic, French, and Hindi as a starting point to resource the above movements, furthering the work of the AAG goals and objectives.

Working with 24:14, we aim to help equip the 9 million churches and 115 million disciples in the 1,966 movements to bring Scripture translation into their evangelism, disciple-making, and church-planting work. In 2024, we held four training events (three with East and West African movement leaders and one with Northern Indian movement leaders). In 2025, we aim to continue the work with those leaders as well as continue multiplying new leaders.","The largest alliance of DMMs and CPMs we are working with is called 24:14. unfoldingWord was asked this year to spearhead their Bible translation training and begin building relationships with the movement leaders. We are not aware of any other projects that match this multimodal training process among these large-scale movements besides the ones unfoldingWord is working with. In June 2024, unfoldingWord performed a vision-casting trip with New Generations, a large-scale DMM, and we are working with them on a similar multimodal training program.","The timely completion of the AAGs will require new approaches to multiplying Bible translation trainers. In order to translate into the languages of the most unreached people groups, a Training of Trainers approach can access restrictive and hostile areas and is a critical component to fulfilling the AAG objective. As unfoldingWord implements the multimodal training approach in conjunction with global DMM/CPM networks and practitioners, we will be mobilizing and equipping an entirely new Great Commission labor force with untapped potential; master trainers and local/indigenous translators.

Equipping translators and local leaders with the necessary skills, tools, and understanding of the translation process will help achieve the AAGs as well as establish healthy churches. By working with local churches and their movement leaders, the sustainability of translation projects is in the hands of those who need Bible translation the most.

By providing access to data, methodologies, and progress updates, we foster an environment where ETEN members and these church movements can leverage one another’s expertise and accelerate their respective translation initiatives.","The multimodal training approach is designed to multiply trainers. This Training of Trainers program is built in collaboration with iLab and the 24:14 movement leaders and created to reproduce Bible translation (BT) trainers and translations with less dependence on long-term funding. Each training event builds capacity in the trainers so that they can go and train new BT trainers in their regions. 

Our long-term aim is to establish strategic hubs in secure locations where trainers can gather two to three times per year for ongoing equipping and honing of their skills. This methodology provides the BT world with an interdependent and international network of trainers to meet their own translation needs.

To this end, we have a unique opportunity to work with ETEN to catalyze a movement that is owned, empowered, and sustained through local national leaders. Movement trainers are equipped to share the knowledge and insights gained with their broader networks. The multimodal program includes Stations of Generosity (www.stationsofgenerosity.org) training so that the Bible translation process has long-term, regional, and sustainable funding.

The forum will be held in an accessible location for our global participants and will take place in December 2025. 

The CCBT network is healthier and more functional when members understand that they are part of a global community; the CCBT forum strengthens this sense of community in tangible ways. Going into our fourth year, the intent is to grow our reach by increasing the number of participants and focusing on economic sustainability by inviting more partners to contribute financially. 

As the only global gathering of CCBT practitioners, this annual event focuses on creating and fostering a self-perpetuating worldwide movement of church-based translation practitioners through the exchange of ideas, technology, best practices, and replicable field experiences. Two critical outcomes of this event are the real-time learning that takes place for all involved, as well as the lasting relationships that lead to on-going bilateral and multilateral collaboration in the field.","There are numerous barriers to creating Bible translations for minority groups. While there are many vibrant and growing majority language churches, there are still many indigenous people groups without a local church or viable access to Scripture in their heart language. In communist and Muslim countries, for example, Christianity is highly restricted and the context for gospel work can be both high-risk and isolated. These are the same areas where many of our CCBT partners and practitioners operate. 

Those working in isolated, remote areas with least-reached people groups have expressed the desire to communicate, collaborate, and learn from translators implementing CCBT in other countries and contexts. For Indigenous leaders, especially from Global South cultures where trust and personal relationships are paramount, synergies create and innovation occurs during face-to-face interactions with their brothers and sisters in Christ who are united in the same passion—to bring the gospel to every person in their heart language.
 
Additionally, there is a critical need for further theological formation of the existing church. The absence of opportunity for training in restricted environments and the lack of Bible study tools greatly limit the accuracy and effectiveness of the teaching and preaching ministries in the church. Pastors, teachers, and church leaders are very committed but often serve without the tools to help them effectively teach the Bible.","The Global CCBT Forum addresses these needs by gathering strategic leaders across the Global South into one location for strategic networking, prayer, and cross-organizational learning opportunities. In 2025, we will invite 150 participants which accounts for adding at least four new Global South partners. These leaders are like modern-day apostle Pauls with their own missionary bands around them. The networking aspect of the CCBT forum is to energize connections between sub-networks that will collectively shape a vision for what is happening worldwide. This process will increase independent and interdependent partnerships, address networking challenges, and develop inter-network relationships through face-to-face interactions. 

The Global South ministry leaders and church-planting networks will present their insights and experiences, shedding light on the latest advancements, methodologies, and best practices in CCBT. This will help develop creativity within the various teams and help them see additional avenues that lead to quality CCBT. The program also addresses common challenges, provides ways to solve them, and encourages innovative thinking. By providing a safe space to network and build meaningful relationships, the networks will continue to strengthen their bonds outside of the forum. unfoldingWord acts as a catalyst and each network is ultimately empowered to own and carry forth these learnings into their many spheres of influence.","There are no other existing projects similar to what we are proposing, that we are aware of.","The forum’s expected impact is the strategic orchestration of the global CCBT movement (networks, projects, skills training, systems, and collaboration) that will complete the worldwide AAGs in the shortest time possible. The forum’s focus of participants sharing effective translation processes and methodologies means that CCBT networks are syncing their learning and successes to refine tools and maximize technology. One example is the June 2024 VCANA cross training that took place in Juba. Based on the relational capital which was built during the forum, the Eurasian team was able to train the Sudanese team on using their VCANA drafting tool, who in turn was able to test this tool. Ultimately, this forum will yield more trainers for the worldwide CCBT workforce. The long-term result of this well-organized global network will be a strengthened church by providing all people access to God’s Word. 

In addition, a key result of the forum is connecting individuals in the CCBT movement with more Bible translation organizations to foster deeper and broader partnerships. This supports the long-term sustainability of the CCBT movement into the future through extensive, strong relationships between Bible translation organizations and others that resource them. In this mix will be a strong cadre of next-generation leaders who understand the needs of the movement to complete the AAGs.","Currently ETEN's partnership and support is key for enabling unfoldingWord to sponsor the annual Global CCBT Forum. We also have two other major donors that are partners in sponsoring these annual forums. unfoldingWord leverages the forum’s inspirational outcomes by gathering original content and powerful testimonials. As an alliance partner and in direct relationship to the illumiNations marketing and branding team, providing robust testimonials, videos, and photos strongly impacts stewardship collateral for the illumiNations nationwide brand. Additionally, it communicates progress beyond the CCBT networks, builds donor and church interest in the movement, and inspires broader financial partners. In 2024, this has directly contributed to a growing number of new supporters to the ministry. 

Eventually, to promote sustainability through ownership and buy-in to CCBT, unfoldingWord expects a portion of the funding to come from the national communities and church networks who will raise funding to send their local representatives to these critical events. This year, we will be asking our Global South partners to cover their transportation costs while we provide their accommodations and food.",7012G0000012NYEQA2,Capacity Building - Quality Assurance

The teams have also received training from Wycliffe USA on the Chameleon Motion Capture software which is currently being used by the Ho Chi Minh Sign Language translation team. In partnership with FEBC and local church networks, unfoldingWord is diligently working to fill the gap of translators and translations for all Vietnamese people. unfoldingWord is excited about this new partnership between FEBC and DAVAR International, audio Bible recording, which began in August 2023.

Vietnamese is a Resource Level 3 Strategic Language in the iLab's Strategic Language Initiative. The work being done by FEBC can feed directly into the Bible Aquifer and includes the types of content that are appropriate for  Resource Level 3 languages. This includes exegetical resources, a Bible dictionary, and comprehension questions. This set of resources builds upon foundational Bible stories (Open Bible Stories - OBS) which are used for training new translation teams and as a tool for evangelism and discipleship in developing networks.",1945720.0,1036406.0,0.0,600000.0,400000.0,31.0,400000.0,"Of the two WBWN projects, this one seems like the higher strategic. With a hard to reach area and more AAGs that are unmet, I think if we were to fund one of the two I would recommend this one. HOW MANY AAG LANGUAGES WERE TRANSLATED LAST YEAR ON THIS?","MEDIUM - Price is a bit high, but they are accomplishing completion of AAGs.", ,24.0,18.0,"Vietnam, a nation with high persecution rates and a small Christian population, has a repressive Communist government that severely restricts Christian worship and outreach. The Vietnamese church has requested assistance in translating the Bible into the country’s 54 distinct languages, but these pleas have largely gone unanswered due to a lack of trained teams, funding, and time. Through a partnership with Far East Broadcasting Company (FEBC), unfoldingWord seeks to empower these local groups by enhancing their own translation capacity. By training translation teams to utilize resources from unfoldingWord and the Bible Aquifer, the churches will be equipped to translate the Bible accurately and confidently for themselves.

unfoldingWord seeks to establish a self-sustaining movement within local church networks to reach all associated unreached peoples using the Church-Centric Bible Translation (CCBT) model. This Whole Bible Whole Nation (WBWN) initiative encompasses first-time translations, revisions of existing translations, additional desired translations, and the creation of supporting biblical resources such as study guides, commentaries, maps, and dictionaries. By focusing on local resources, unfoldingWord helps local churches update and improve their translations with final approval by the church instead of outside experts, ensuring accessibility and accuracy, enabling the church to endure for future generations.","As one of the five remaining communist countries in the world, Vietnam presents numerous barriers to Bible translation efforts for minority groups. To reach the entire country of Vietnam, a new Bible translation is needed in at least 45 minority languages and three sign languages. It should be noted that the goal of 45 new translations could change significantly due to there being 118 dialects among the 54 minority languages. 

Due to illiteracy and oral culture, almost all minority groups in Vietnam will need an audio Bible. Another critical need in Vietnam is for further theological formation of the existing church. The lack of opportunity for training in this restricted environment coupled with the lack of Bible study tools greatly limits the accuracy and effectiveness of the teaching and preaching ministries in the church. As a result, believers in the church are slow to reach maturity in their faith. Pastors, teachers, and church leaders are very dedicated but often are serving without the tools to help them effectively teach the Bible.","WBWN Vietnam aims to build capacity by equipping church networks in Vietnam with open-licensed translation resources, tools, and training. These initiatives ensure that the church can translate the Bible, conduct quality assurance checks, and sustain their translations over time without relying on foreign experts.

Building on our existing work producing resources in Vietnamese, in 2025 our strategy is to collaborate with iLab and BiblioNexus to develop and test open-licensed Vietnamese translation resources for the Bible Aquifer and equip the Vietnamese SL team in their use. FEBC aims to engage with seven minority language groups to accelerate their current unmet AAG goals and complete two New Testaments (NT) for the Tai Dam and Nung. 

Due to high illiteracy rates and a highly oral culture (80% of the population), FEBC will continue to partner with DAVAR to produce audio versions of completed translations for the Katu, Kor, Mnong-Rlam, Roglai-Southern, Sedang, and T’rin minority groups, whose NT AAG goals were met as of April 30, 2024, and uploaded into the Digital Bible Library (DBL). In partnership with Wycliffe USA, the Ho Chi Minh Sign Language team will also continue to produce video content of the NT through the use of Chameleon Motion Capture software.","We recognize that the Vietnamese Bible Society, SIL, and the Seed Company are actively engaged in translation projects within Vietnam. While their focus is on translating and providing access to various texts, our approach involves not only translation but also collaborating with local churches, conducting community checks, and distributing written and audio-translated Scriptures. This comprehensive process ensures that the materials are both linguistically accurate and contextually relevant for the local communities we serve. Additionally, we are committed to helping FEBC provide local churches, evangelists, and disciple-makers with biblical texts and other evangelism tools in real time to support their ongoing Great Commission work.","In 2025, FEBC will aim to translate the following six minority languages: Maa, Phuong, Todrah, Halang, Tày, and Hanoi Sign Language to accelerate their current unmet AAG goals and finish several NTs by 2026. The church communities of these minority languages will be encouraged and hearts will be changed. The theological formation of the unreached people groups (UPGs) will develop as they transition from non-existent or young, immature churches, to established churches. As there is more of God’s Word available in the heart language, there will be greater understanding of the gospel and it will be used more and more in the churches. Eventually, close to 98 million people will have access to all of God’s Word once the WBWN Vietnam program is complete.

As the Vietnamese SL team continues working with the various minority language groups, the teams will gain the skills and best practices necessary to help their churches translate the Bible. This will increase the minority language translation teams’ effectiveness in translation as they manage the Scripture translation and revision, and also have a greater impact on their communities as they are involved in the checking process.","Over time, unfoldingWord expects most of the funding of these projects to come from the resources within the local communities and church networks themselves. Part of the philosophy of Church-Centric Bible Translation is the structuring of projects to increasingly use local resources to ensure long-term sustainability - it is inherent in our goal of equipping locals to do the work for themselves. 

In the meantime, the support that ETEN provides continues to be crucial for enabling unfoldingWord to begin these translation projects.  unfoldingWord also continually invites additional partners (Wycliffe USA, Biblica, the R.B. Nordick Foundation) into funding its various projects; we are actively working to bring other funders to support the work in Vietnam. As these other partners become connected, they will provide more of the funds needed in the future.",7012G0000012NYEQA2,Capacity Building - Quality Assurance

Seed Company is exploring how to integrate the MLQA role into the Quality Assurance Communities so that these communities can be replicated much more quickly. 

Seed Company is also working with several international organizations such as Lutheran Bible Translators, several SIL entities, Dallas International University, Bible Society, DOOR, and Wycliffe Global Partnerships as well as national translation organizations to agree on the core competencies required of an MLQA.",1198000.0,0.0,,480000.0,200000.0,40.0,200000.0,,HIGH - Mid level consultant roles. Where does multi-model fit into this? Believe this might shift the velocity metric and remove the bottleneck towards Bible Translation. Lab agrees that this would be a good investment.,,17.29,21.0,"We identified three main tactics used by the fastest translation teams after an in-depth analysis of nearly 1,000 translation projects in which Seed Company is privileged to partner.
1. Accelerated Drafting. The fastest teams use some kind of accelerated drafting technique. Either a software like AI-assisted drafting or larger teams accelerate drafting simply by dividing the labor and simultaneously working on several passages.
2. Accelerated Checking. Not relying on a translation consultant to enforce quality, the fastest translation teams figured out how to train others to do parts of the quality assurance job so that the translated Scripture is already quite good before being reviewed by a translation consultant.
3. System of Daily Accountability. The fastest translation teams have a person playing the role of a driver who ensures that teams stay on schedule. Some partner organizations have accountability systems as part of their organizational culture, and the fastest translation teams leverage those accountability systems.

A critical role for translation teams to adopt these tactics is a MLQA (mid-level quality assurance). Every translation project needs a driver who is also equipped to help guide a translation team through a process that results in quality Scripture translation. 

This project seeks to radically increase the number and impact of MLQAs available to the Bible translation movement.","The growth in number of active translation projects has been fast outpacing traditional approaches to ensure the quality of Scripture translation efforts. While advances in technology are making significant contributions to ensuring quality of translation, we can’t get away from critical steps of having the mother tongue speakers and the community interact with the text, discussing key terms, community feedback, etc.  These critical steps have often been directed by highly trained but increasingly rare translation consultants. Equipped MLQAs can lead these critical steps.

Translation projects are also operating in different contexts – as a ministry of the church, in highly restrictive countries, and difficult to access locations – and they are increasingly following different methodologies to achieve the result of quality Scripture translation. MLQAs are equipped to function within each context and their training can be focused to that end.

As with many projects, Scripture translation can get off track due to a variety of issues, and an equipped MLQA working consistently with the translation team will be able to keep translation projects on track to accomplish their goals in a timely manner.","This project seeks to radically increase the number and impact of MLQAs available to the Bible translation movement through four key strategies:

1. Equip individuals through a customized growth plan to rapidly gain the competencies of a MLQA (please see attachment titled, ""MLQA White Paper""). We are currently equipping MLQAs in 59 organizations worldwide ranging from Bible Societies, Wycliffe and SIL organizations, Church planting ministries, and local language committees.

2. Harness latent assets already present within the Bible translation movement community that can be leveraged to scale the preparation of MLQAs. A special focus of this effort will be to prepare a workforce to tackle the oncoming rush of Old Testament translation as we near 2033.

3. Explore how to integrate MLQAs into Quality Assurance Communities that will support a variety of methodologies including Church based translation efforts (please see attachment titled, ""QA Community - ETEN Grant""). 

4. Continue to refine and scale MLQA training for individuals serving in some of the most difficult to access language communities – due to geographic, political and/or religious reasons. These individuals will need unique skills to operate with isolated translation teams.","Several organizations run programs that are similar to parts of what we are proposing, but no organization has the reach to carry out a project at the scale we are attempting.","By our estimation close to 400 new Old Testament translation efforts will launch by 2027 in order to complete their goals by 2033. More than 200 of these will be languages on the AAG list and the others will be in languages where the New Testament is completed but the Old Testament is needed and requested by the Church. Equipped MLQAs will help translation teams make use of all available resources, working more effectively and efficiently to accelerate translation since they are not dependent on external leadership.","Trained MLQAs, once deployed in active translation projects, will receive compensation because of their leadership in the translation projects. In some cases where the projects are sponsored by international agencies, salaries will come through project budgets. In other cases, as in Indonesia, MLQAs are ordained and on the payroll of church denominations.",7012G0000012NYEQA2,Capacity Building - Quality Assurance

Of these, 75 (20%) have been found to have low vitality or their goal met through the L2. The goal has been to clarify the AAG list so that the language communities with Bible translation needs can be prioritized. 
Recent research by Anonby, Simanjuntak, and Eberhard has shown that many text translations and audio recordings are not being used, despite some instances  of strong community ownership and church engagement (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hI_8yGWA_fSthwuQL6JPDRN9aISPLSDIcyMV9THyn1A/edit). 
There are many reasons for the lack of Scripture adoption and use, but research is showing that the more fundamental reasons may be outside our control. In general, churches may adopt Scripture if the Scriptures are available at the church’s inception (amongst unreached people groups) but will often struggle to adopt L1 Scripture if the church is already well formed and using Scripture in a language of wider communication. In many multilingual communities, once the language is set for a specific domain (like church, Scripture reading, Bible study, the market, education, home, etc.), changing the patterns of language choice may be rare. General estimates are that less than ⅓ of communities will have a complete adoption of the translated Scriptures.","It is critical that the Bible translation movement has the best data for informed decision making. Without good information, the world has peopleless Bibles and precious human and financial resources are lost. We often ask questions like, “What does the community need?” where a more appropriate question would be “What will the community use?” From the research in Indonesia, it is estimated that at least 50-100 languages can be removed from the Translation Not Started list marked as goal met through L2. This project aims to clarify the All Access Goals in Indonesia where research has been performed and continue research in other countries to confirm if this holds true in other contexts, or to uncover exceptions to the rule. 
The current known exceptions are:
-The language of wider communication (LWC) Scriptures are associated with conflict/separatism/oppression.
-L2 Scripture is in a neighboring minority language community, not a national language.
-This LWC is not a prestige language and is not considered one of the markers of the language community’s identity.
-L2 Scripture is in a prestige language, but one that is not used as a significant part of community’s life outside of church, one in which they are neither fluent nor literate.
-The L1 is itself an LWC, one that functions as a strong regional or national identity marker. 
-The use of L1 Scripture in church is a prior policy of an external church hierarchy & this policy is followed at the local level.","EGIDS ( https://www.ethnologue.com/faq/what-is-egids/) was used in the creation of the AAGs. Original strategists designing the AAGs determined that the AAGs would focus on vital languages, where children were still speaking the language (EGIDS 6b and stronger). New research indicates that there are factors just as critical to vitality in the successful adoption and usage of Scripture. Similar to EGIDS, this project hopes to create understanding of multilingualism so that Bible translation organizations can prioritize communities that have the greatest likelihood of Scripture adoption and use. 
For the Data Sharpening Initiative v.2, we intend to:
-Clarify AAGs in Indonesia. We anticipate at least 50 languages can be removed from the Translation Not Started list, although it could be as high as 100.  
-Engage in 2 more research projects in Francophone Africa and the Pacific, modeled after the research in Indonesia. We invite ETEN partners to collaborate on this research project by helping us uncover additional exceptions to the rule. 
-Clean up data in Francophone Africa and the Pacific based on the research findings. 
-Continue engaging in the data sharpening initiative, with a specific focus on languages that have their needs met through L2. We anticipate we will uncover 50 additional languages with their goals met through L2.
-Discover the best geographical area to research how Oral Bible Translation (OBT) products are adopted after the process has been",,"This project will have significant impact on the All Access Goals. First, it will provide decision makers with better information when planning a Bible translation project. Second, it will allow a prioritization of the Bible translation needs, with clarity on which language communities have their needs met through a language of wider communication. If it holds true in other contexts, the end of Bible poverty will occur more quickly than previously thought.",This is a short-term project and will only last two years.,7012G0000012NYEQA2,Capacity Building - Quality Assurance

The initiative is designed to create an environment where new and existing Oral Bible Translation (OBT) projects can thrive and multiply, leading to a significant increase in completed Bible translations and broader community engagement with Scripture. To achieve these ambitious goals, the OBT Table will focus on three key supporting objectives: advocating for ongoing initiatives that bolster the sustainability of the movement, enhancing the reporting, management, and utilization of data, and building capacity through comprehensive training and responsible stewardship of tools, finances, and exegetical resources. This approach aims to ensure that the momentum of OBT projects not only continues but also grows exponentially, enabling more communities around the world to access and engage with the Bible in their own languages.",,"The Oral Bible Translation (OBT) Affinity Table is playing a pivotal role in driving a movement that is significantly advancing the global effort to accomplish Bible translation. As of 2024, there are nearly 1,000 active Bible translation projects underway, a testament to the momentum and influence of this initiative. The OBT Affinity Table has been instrumental in closing the gap in Bible translation by fostering collaboration, innovation, and sustainability among translation teams and organizations. Its strategic focus on scaling efforts through effective models, data management, and capacity building has empowered more communities to engage with Scripture in their own languages. By creating a supportive and resource-rich environment, the OBT Affinity Table is not only accelerating the pace of Bible translations but also ensuring that these projects are sustainable and capable of reaching even the most remote and underserved linguistic communities.","The Oral Bible Translation (OBT) Affinity is strategically planning to decrease its dependency on external funding by cultivating stronger partnerships with a diverse range of donors and by empowering local leadership. By expanding its network of supporters, the OBT Affinity aims to create a more resilient and diversified funding base, reducing the reliance on any single source of financial support. Additionally, the focus on empowering local leadership is critical; by equipping local communities with the tools, training, and resources needed to take ownership of translation projects, the OBT Affinity is fostering self-sufficiency and sustainability. As local leaders gain the capacity to manage and lead these efforts independently, the need for external financial support will diminish, allowing the movement to thrive with greater autonomy and local investment.

This community-driven project aims to provide church networks with software components that can be adapted to local needs, facilitating more effective and independent Bible translation efforts worldwide.","We aim to address the lack of accessible, user-friendly Bible translation technology, particularly in regions with limited resources and skilled translators. Current solutions often require high-tech infrastructure and external support, making it difficult for church networks to meet their unique translation needs independently. Shared innovation and solutions are lacking, hindering the advancement of Scripture translation in unreached people groups.","The Open Component Ecosystem fosters open-source collaboration with a strong emphasis on creating modular, componentized, extensible, and reusable tools that church networks can use independently, reducing the need for high-tech infrastructure and external support. This year, we are particularly excited about adding AI and mobile application components to our library of open-component technology.

By providing reusable building blocks, mentorship, and community engagement, we enable even the hardest-to-reach regional developers to create and customize tools that meet local needs. This approach reduces the time required to test and deploy new ideas, fostering a global ecosystem of innovation and shared solutions in Bible technology.","While there are efforts to partner on particular software projects throughout Bible translation organizations, we are not aware of any that are working on jointly developing the building blocks of Bible translation software to be reused in multiple applications, making our solution a high priority to meet the local needs of the church.","The Open Component Ecosystem (OCE) is poised to significantly accelerate progress toward the All-Access Goals (AAGs) being completed by 2033.

This approach enhances the speed and accuracy of Bible translation, increases the capacity of local teams, and allows for culturally and contextually appropriate tools. Empowering regional teams to iterate on and deploy these tools ensures that translation efforts are closely aligned with local needs, reducing bottlenecks and delays.

Additionally, the OCE fosters a global community of developers who share and iterate on innovative solutions, reducing the redundancy of starting from scratch for each new project. This collective approach maximizes resources and expertise across the Bible translation movement, pushing the AAGs closer to realization.

HIGH,HIGH - Great resource used by many - High priority for assisted technology. Moving towards multimodel.,May need to go to Lab for 2025 influence - TBD,12.35,10.0,"Scribe is a multimodal (text and audio) Bible translation editor that is developed and focused on the needs of church-based Bible translators, allowing local churches and church movements to produce the Bible in both oral or written formats according to their unique needs. The average mother tongue translator is not technically savvy and is typically living in an environment that lacks reliable electricity and internet access. Scribe is designed from the ground up to assist translation teams by targeting both offline and online use cases and has a robust backup mechanism. Moreover, one of the unique features of Scribe is its focus on making the user interface (UI) intuitive and easy, even for those who are newly introduced to a computer.

In keeping with our desire to make Scribe open and freely available, the application is developed as an open-source project with an open license. We encourage collaboration with other partners and organizations to meet specific needs, making Scribe more relevant to a broad set of users. Our openness has already borne fruit and we have active contributors from other organizations who contribute of their own accord. The code of the app is built in collaboration with the Codex project and we strive to keep good code quality to support long-term maintenance and with ease for new developers’ onboarding.","Scribe was developed as a response to multiple unmet needs expressed by translators with existing tools. Problems including, but are not limited to:
1. Mother tongue translators (MTTs) are usually unfamiliar with using advanced applications. They are often not exposed to new technology. Therefore, they need an application that is easy to start using, keeps the complexity hidden, and reveals the necessary features at the right time.

2. Each translation team is unique and is best served by tools that can be adjusted to meet their specific needs. However, developing custom-made tools for multiple teams is impractical and cost-prohibitive. An open, modular, and documented application was needed that used modern standards that could serve as the basis for adding or modifying features for specific translation team needs.","Scribe was designed from the ground up to address the problems listed above in the following ways:
1. Scribe has an easy-to-use interface and makes editing Bible text and audio simple and straightforward. The user experience (UX) was developed by taking into account feedback from multiple grassroots translation teams and making use of the latest advances in technology for user interfaces. An important point is that simplicity does not preclude the user from carrying out complex tasks. Rather, Scribe makes use of sensible defaults with popular and established interface patterns to enable translators to focus on the actual task of translation and not be distracted by the idiosyncrasies of the interface.

2. The Scribe application has been refactored and built in collaboration with the Codex project that is funded by the ETEN Innovation Lab. This allows for Scribe to be modular and makes it possible for other developers in the Bible translation ecosystem to reuse the same base application and only add their features or adjust features to their liking. Since the whole application is planned for ownership by the BiblioNexus Foundation and is made available open source and freely licensed, Scribe is an open, free, and fully-featured application to build further functionality atop of easily. Indeed this is how the Scribe team internally develops new features.","Platform.Bible (SIL): This project is similar to Scribe but has a different technology direction, goals, and objectives. The biggest difference is that Scribe chose to use an existing application (VS Code) to build atop of, unlike Platform.Bible which builds the whole application from scratch. Moreover, Scribe has a strong focus on ease of use.","A simple and usable editor is a fundamental requirement for achieving systematic and incremental progress toward the AAGs. An editor is the home where a translation team spends most of its time, and the effectiveness of their hours spent directly translates into the speed of progress. With no or little training, a simple user interface effectively hides complexity, and empowers users with the latest AI tools, enabling developers to quickly build their features while remaining openly licensed and free. This unique feature makes Scribe a project that has the potential to drastically improve the speed and quality of text and oral Bible translation projects.

Scribe has over 350+ users across South Asian and African regions supporting several text and oral Bible translation projects. In 2025, we plan to dramatically improve the stability of the application, standardize the user interface, and add more features to support AI-related and oral Bible translation needs.","Scribe has chosen to build in collaboration with the Codex Project which is led by the ETEN Innovation Lab. This allows Scribe to build atop an established and commercially successful framework of Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Therefore, the maintenance burden of the application is minimized to only the modules that are specifically targeted toward the Bible translation use cases. The co-pilot features built into Codex are directly applicable to use within Scribe. Since we are working in close collaboration with other partners who are already building for their geographically distinct translation teams, the development and maintenance cost is amortized and leads to quicker development. Moreover, being completely owned and supported by the BiblioNexus Foundation, the open-source codebase and open licensing engender further community involvement, driving the reduction of future costs.",7012G0000012NMNQA2,Translation Tools

SURV supports community data validation, followed by MEET to mobilize and manage projects.

SURV is a data and survey pathway and a backend database that includes geographic, social, and linguistic data. With collaborative data entry and aggregation, SURV gives Deaf communities the opportunity to participate in validating the data needed to mobilize translation projects. Findings are documented and reported in ways that partner organizations can access and leverage for tactical purposes in project starts.

MEET is an end-to-end project management system to Mobilize and Engage Effective Translations. As the name suggests, this system enables us to meet Deaf communities where they are, with whatever strengths and assets they have. MEET’s design is tailored to SL communicators, so Deaf field coordinators can readily use it for onboarding, management, and streamlining of all activities that surround translation efforts. The toolset integrates previously disparate systems to keep forward focus on translation while also providing the business and administrative checkpoints needed for good stewardship, progress, quality, and distribution via the Deaf Bible.

These tools have been developed independently and with awareness of their potential to seamlessly integrate from one workflow to the next.","Broadly, MEET (with update Surv integration) help to address problems that hinder AAG progress and acceleration, for example:
Data Quality, Curation, and Integration — Diverse sources of SL data vs. curating and aggregating in a shared ‘source of truth’ accessible to all partners
Consultant Capacity — Insufficient consultant capacity to provide timely collaboration
Language Inefficiency — Inefficiencies due to dependency on SL interpretation that could be streamlined
Language Accessibility — Tools and resources developed for written/oral communicators that are still being revamped for SL communicators.
For 2025, several problems present opportunities to develop a more integrated workflow:
Responsive Roadmap with AI Foundations — Develop according to a responsive roadmap that expands AI integration capacity; carry forward insights from our 2024 mid-year report of higher than expected engagement and increased attention to partner communication and context sharing.
Language and Geographic Adaptability — Pursue validation and implementation, undeterred by the goals that were collectively pursued via 55 Table efforts, which opened opportunity for us to shift away from the 2024 plan for collective mobilization in India; continue SURV and MEET development through DBS engagement in East Asia.
Training and Teamwork – Improve Deaf collaboration and efficiency as these two toolsets connect SL data to new projects; sharing knowledge horizontally through Deaf training, teaming, an","Through SL data curation from key sources and “push” integration with Progress.Bible, there is an ongoing drive to validate sign language plans and progress while expanding capacity for AI integration and timely project support through training and resources.

For example, solutions provided MEET and SURV in 2025 will advance:
Language Validation — Continue auditing and confirming the locked AAG sign languages list emerging projects with a focus on East Asia.
AI Integration — Continue developing Generative AI features in response to positive feedback and effectiveness already realized.
Feedback Implementation — Gather the quantity and quality of feedback that accelerates the refinement of resources and tools.
Community Engagement — Cultivate the Virtual Community Network for emerging projects and leaders that has exceeded expectations, providing insight for community-driven initiatives and local Deaf leaders support.
Key Contributors — Recognize valuable contributors to MEET’s real-time community feedback system, who support quality assurance and acceleration.
Volunteers — Engage volunteers to access an ecosystem of training resources and translation participation in a “as available” capacity; building future leaders and increasing hands at work in community-accessible aspects of translation projects.
Exemplars — Identify projects achieving the most favorable pace and ROI in verse completions, leveraging their mentorship and exploring how to incentivize others.","SURV — Not to our knowledge. Other partners do have awarness on data collection efforts that are academic in nature and rely heavily on partner input and validation in spreadsheets. In contrast, the SURV project relies heavily on direct connectivity with and insights from national Deaf field collaborators. 

MEET — No; although after DBS offered MEET demos and invitations to collaboration that would include transparency to its toolsets, an implementing partner expressed their intention to develop the same capacity for their project management (which includes some sign language engagement). We are often asked how we have created and succeeded at certain elements within our technology so that others can “go build” and “implement” within their agency rather than collaborate via an open and shared tool. The following organizations have learned from our systems, copied ideas, or expressed interest to learn from our systems; UBS, Faith Comes by Hearing, Progress Bible, APSDA, Wycliffe, DOOR, Word for the World, Spoken Worldwide,  YWAM, and others.

We remain open to collaboration with partners as we steward our unique, integrated understanding of global Deaf perspectives and technology development.","A Bible scripture publication growth of over 400% and church growth of over 1,000% across new translation projects. Even in the process of development and validation, both SURV and MEET are already accelerating SL translation projects. As of Q2 in 2024, DBS-managed SL translation projects are making completed Scripture accessible at a rate 7 times greater than all other ETEN SL translation projects combined — largely energized by DBS projects following a church-based model.

This acceleration is evidenced by video uploads of completed Scripture verses/chapters now accessible and accounted for in the Deaf Bible. The Deaf Bible remains the single largest source of globally accessible SL Scripture, alongside the smaller footprint of local distribution options such as DVDs and memory cards.

Two DBS-managed projects — in Dominican and Georgian Sign Languages — were mobilized using early versions of SURV and MEET toolsets; mobilization occurred in November 2022 and April 2023 respectively. These projects continue to be managed with MEET. As of early 2024, both projects demonstrated dynamic progress and pacing to qualify for grants from the ETEN Acceleration Fund.

SURV and MEET are setting a new precedent and modality of work and value that ETEN partner organizations are beginning to imitate, as noted in question 6.

The information gathered and managed by these tools can inform prioritization and strategy for achieving AAGs; then manage projects accordingly.","Funding sustainability comes as these validated and integrated toolsets support accelerated language starts and well-managed translation projects aligned with AAG and ETEN metrics; therefore, DBS would ideally receive funds for ongoing maintenance and development according to existing metrics and allocations. 

That said, the existing metrics and allocations have not always aligned with on-the-ground reality of accelerating sustained SL projects. For sustainability, DBS is also maintaining (with separate funding) the integration of SURV and MEET within our larger Deaf Bible Engagement Ecosystem.

Overall, our goal for this proposal is to enhance DBL’s compatibility with other translation tools, with a focus on Oral and Sign Language content, to refine the creation and usage of Open Licensing, such as Creative Commons and Public Domain, and to provide more comprehensive reporting to organizations using DBL and its supporting partners.

The resumption of an in-person DBL Summit and the introduction of virtual office hours for efficient onboarding and training will undergird the platform's readiness and foster community engagement.","A growing number of tools are requesting direct integration to DBL, similar to Paratext. We aim to streamline integration across as many translation tools as possible, prioritizing those with strong community usage. Oral and Sign Language (SL) translations require unique support, including large file handling and media-specific extensions to metadata.
The SL community, along with Deaf Bible Society, has asked DBL to simplify importing videos via API upload. In 2024, we developed the architecture and API. In 2025, we will work with DBS to complete this integration, and we plan to invite other early adopters seeking automated content uploading.
As more Scripture is contributed, organizations are requesting processes to manage licensed content rapidly. The platform should emphasize open-access defaults like Creative Commons licenses while allowing organizations to import specific terms.
Transparency and flexibility in reporting are increasingly requested. Content owners want reports or APIs to analyze and share the information they’ve licensed within DBL. We aim to support organizations evaluating their effectiveness in deploying Scripture through generous partnering and open-access licenses.
We must continue engaging the DBL community. Feedback from past DBL Summits highlights the value of this community and their enjoyment in connecting with DBL staff and users globally.

We're also enhancing accessibility, allowing additional translation tools to integrate.
Translation Acceleration: We're broadening functionality to support more translation tools, focusing on Oral and Sign Language (SL) needs, allowing them to embed DBL resources in their tools.
Direct Uploader: We will enable web-based content uploads within DBL, moving beyond Paratext or Nathanael. This quick-start uploader includes bulk uploading to streamlined transfers, especially for the SL community.
Impact Reporting: Content Owners will benefit from being able to set specific reporting KPIs and receive feedback from Distributors. User-friendly forms will collect necessary data, and reports will be accessible via the DBL dashboard.
In-App Reporting: A new dashboard will give organizations insights into their content and licensing data and track progress toward AAG goals. We will also extend data sharing with ProgressBible and Mission Mutual.
Community Support: Based on previous attendee responses, we will host DBL events that blend in-person and virtual engagements. To support the growing DBL community, we will offer Product Walkthroughs and Onboarding Workshops, with both live and on-demand options for flexible learning.
Licensing Insight: We plan to analyze licensing feedback and usage, particularly regarding open license agreements, to identify and address issues in the licensing process.","We collaborate closely with partner agencies and tool developers within the ETEN alliance, so similar themes may appear in their work. However, no other project fully replicates what the Digital Bible Library (DBL) offers. DBL serves as a vital, trusted infrastructure for the Bible Translation community, uniquely positioned in its scope and impact. DBL uniquely provides:
Comprehensive Content: DBL supports Open Access (e.g., Creative Commons, Public Domain) content in addition to major language translations, typically restricted by traditional licenses, making DBL a preeminent resource for mission impact and translation acceleration.
Efficiency and Integration: DBL’s one-click approval process for Translation Stewards facilitates the use of Bibles as Translation Resources in Paratext, significantly accelerating the translation process for thousands of language communities.
Foundational Role: As the first project commissioned by ETEN, DBL has been integral to its mission since its inception. DBL’s longstanding role underscores its foundational importance and the trust equity it stewards on behalf of the ETEN alliance.
Distribution Partnerships: DBL is the trusted Scripture provider for YouVersion and has earned the trust of over 750 Great Commission ministry partners, highlighting its reliability and influence.","DBL serves in numerous ways to facilitate ETEN’s broader goals, and specifically to help with increasing velocity in completing the AAG via:
AAG Language Discovery: bringing awareness to AAG languages submitted to DBL but not previously visible in ProgressBible. 
AAG Missional Deployment: making it easier for users and organizations to find and download AAG content, helping to get it into the hearts and hands of those who need it most.
AAG Translation Completions: Additional data sharing and reporting with ProgressBible and Mission Mutual will focus on the status of AAG translations. 
Progress-based metrics: provide periodic snapshots of AAG language data needed to determine annual investments.
Incremental Publishing insight: facilitate incremental publishing paths to encourage regular content updating, which improves ProgressBible's velocity analysis.
Creative Commons support: streamlining licensing and support of CC-BY and CC-BY-SA licensing. Helping Owners contribute content and license it faster and simplifying Distributors' access to open-access content will improve ministry utilization.","From 2023 to 2024, we successfully reduced DBL's core operational expenses by restructuring, streamlining processes, and implementing automation. These efficiencies have enabled us to allocate more resources to new feature development (CAPEX) rather than day-to-day maintenance (OPEX). We have entered the latter phase of the infrastructure modernization effort for DBL, during which we anticipate a decrease in CAPEX as we shift focus from foundational upgrades to community engagement and open integration with other translation tools. We look forward to continuing our partnership with ETEN to enhance features that benefit the entire ecosystem.
In addition to ETEN’s investment in DBL, ABS has jointly contributed additional funding to match funds received from ETEN towards DBL and related systems in 2023 and 2024.
Moreover, the advancements within DBL have garnered increased interest from several organizations. We are now in strategic discussions to explore how this renewed interest can drive collective sustainability.",7012G0000012NMNQA2,Translation Tools

For software developers, UBS is providing 3 developers: one full time Tech Lead, one part-time Senior Developer and one part-time contractor. 
For product management, DOOR is providing a full-time (Deaf) Product Manager, a part-time (Deaf) Bible Translation Domain Expert, and part-time a tester. 
In addition to written/visual resources from UBS’s MARBLE resources and published signed translations via Deaf Bible Society and the Digital Bible Library (DBL), our Translation Resource Library (TRL) is designed to host signed resource content developed by SLBT partners (e.g. DOOR, Deaf Harbor, Whole World Institute, and Wycliffe Global Partners).
We have also provided UBS access to our API to provide project metadata and progress through their Insights project.

We are continuing discussions with other technologies that support sign language translation efforts such as Wycliffe Australia’s Chameleon (a software for rendering an avatar over translators on film), SIL’s SooSL (a sign language dictionary platform), and SIL’s Anonymizer AI software.

What is needed to see this grow?",MEDIUM - * could we see this developed more through collaborations with AVTT/ABS Digital Lab., ,28.0,21.0,"Written translation efforts have software like Paratext to support their needs. These programs rely heavily on written language, both in the translation process and in the administrative oversight of translation progress. These tools are largely inaccessible to Deaf teams, who struggle with written language. The Sign Language Translation Tool (SLTT) provides a technology platform that specifically supports the video requirements of sign language Bible translation (SLBT).
SLTT focuses on the first three phases of the translation process: exegesis, drafting, and quality assurance. SLTT also supports project administrative needs, such as tracking and reporting progress of specific passages. All this helps reduce the time spent by teams to organize and share video files, gather feedback, and ensure quality and consistency across portions of the translation.
The SLTT team works with international SLBT partners (e.g. DOOR International and United Bible Societies (UBS)) as well as individual SLBT teams to identify pain points in the translation process and develop solutions to make the translation process more effective and efficient. 
SLTT actively serves around 59 translation teams, with more teams being added on an ongoing basis, and is provided to all teams free of charge. 

In the words of one Deaf leader (and SLTT user): ""Of all of the innovations that have been rolled out to accelerate sign language Bible translation, SLTT is by far the most effective and forward-moving.","Prior to SLTT, teams that translated the Bible into sign languages struggled to find accessible technology. Due to the video nature of SLBT, the process is highly technical, and existing software to support Bible translation (like Paratext) are highly dependent on written language, resulting in such programs being largely inaccessible. Specific challenges that Deaf teams face include: 
Decentralized Sign Language Resources: During exegesis, Deaf teams need easy access to both textual and (preferably) sign language source texts and exegetical resources to help understand the Bible rather than wasting time switching between websites or programs.
File Naming and Tracking: Deaf teams could often end up overwriting old files or losing track of the latest version of a translation draft. Lost files resulted in re-drafting and lost time for the team.
Complicated Sharing and Feedback: Shared videos had to be watched through a separate video player, and there was no easy way for quality assurance (QA) personnel to provide effective feedback (preferably in sign-language) using video time locations.
Non-integrated tracking: There was no standard way to track passage progress.
Excessive Training - Each new software in the process not only introduced challenges in file transfer and sharing, but also created the need for additional training.","SLTT relieves (SLBT) pain-points by providing: 
Centralized Exegesis: Teams can view published sign language Scriptures related to selected passages, access images and written enhanced texts from UBS’s MARBLE resources, view any relevant Translation Resource Library (TRL) resource, and read translations from the Digital Bible Library (DBL). Teams can document insights to aid in filming the next draft or final video.
Safe and Easy Drafting: A team can create record video drafts within (or upload videos to) SLTT When the team finds mistakes, they can create a new draft or merely patch a small portion of the current draft. Everything is organized without needing filenames. All drafts can be safely restored.
Simple Sharing and Feedback: Shared videos are viewable within SLTT. Teams can compare previous and current drafts, as well as gather and document feedback from the community. QA personnel can easily share written or video feedback with the team about specific drafts and at specific time locations. For QA personnel who may not be fluent in the team’s sign language, the translation team can input a glossed back translation.
Integrated Tracking: The team can now easily update and track their progress. This progress information is available through a trello-like board, a dashboard, and an API.
Simplified Training: Training is now focused on SLTT to do everything. Translation Process training videos are also available in SLTT’s TRL. Many tooltips include sign language videos","As mentioned above, ABS’s Audio Visual Translation Tool (AVTT) is based on SLTT code. It supports audio translation for spoken languages. This tool works with audio files (rather than video files) in support of oral bible translation (OBT).

In the past, DOOR had piloted the use of an Avodah multimedia Bible translation product (text/audio/video). As far as we know, this is no longer being used in any of our partner projects, since much of the user-interface and workflows was not ergonomic for sign language translators.","Feedback from teams has confirmed that the SLTT makes their work much faster compared to the past. Specifically, there were 3 active teams in April 2020, which has grown to 59 active teams in July 2024 (with 70 teams trained on the software). For visual charts, see the “Trained and Active Teams” and “Total Videos Produced” attachments.

With the growing resources available including those from the Translation Resource Library (TRL), we believe those resources will make it easier for SLBT teams to understand and internalize the passages better and be aware of the options that they have for various translation challenges.
Significant reduction in consultant time with the teams (due to more fluid interactions with teams via the SLTT) makes it easier for SLBT teams to reach their goals and frees up more consultant time for other SLBT projects.
Because the program also tracks detailed project events and status changes, this will allow for more accurate and up-to-date representation of AAG progress through our dashboard and reporting API.

It is exciting to see the growing interest in SLTT. We are experiencing a steady growth of active projects that we expect could accelerate more in the next few years. There are many SLBT teams who are interested in using SLTT for their projects, but still need training. For this reason, we plan to increase our training events in 2025 to onboard at least 15 more SLBT teams to use SLTT. Most SLBT teams represent AAG qualifying projects.","Our 2025 ETEN Invitation is about $15,000 less than the total 2025 Project Budget because of upper management time contributed to SLTT.

Our 2025 RFP ETEN invitation is approximately $217,000 less than our 2024 RFP ETEN Invitation because we are seeking a funder outside ETEN to help us hire a mobile developer in 2026 and inviting other participating organizations to share the costs of training events (e.g. in sensitive countries).
This year UBS and DOOR plan to complete an “ETEN Financial Independence Roadmap” for SLTT that will outline goals, action items and milestones that DOOR and UBS have for inviting other funding partners to invest in SLTT and its goals.  

At a high level we are planning to reduce ETEN invitations by 25% of our total budget each year starting in 2026 (reducing our 2026 ETEN invitation by about $140,000).  After 2028, if ETEN would like to continue at 25%-33% of our total budget, that would be appreciated.",7012G0000012NMNQA2,Translation Tools

It harnesses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, assisting translation teams in assessing multiple facets of translation quality by enhancing and complementing preexisting translation work. AQuA is able to produce an increasingly detailed suite of quality-related diagnostics, with several augmented quality assessment methods in the areas of accuracy, naturalness, and clarity. AQuA empowers translation teams in the quality checking process, helping them to more easily spot obvious errors, which in turn lets them focus more of their precious time and attention on the parts of a draft that really need their expertise.

AQuA will be one of the key tools in evaluation and trials conducted alongside Project Catapult and Slingshot implementation workshops.","As the pace of Bible translation increases, with AI methods and other approaches accelerating the drafting phase, the review and quality checking process increasingly becomes a bottleneck. There is a serious risk that the benefits of new drafting techniques could be lost as reviewing work piles up, or that quality is compromised as these drafts are pushed to publication without having been through rigorous checks.

AQuA seeks to give tools to reviewers and checkers, allowing them to keep up with the added workload of drafted Scripture, while ensuring the superior quality of the translation Scriptures, as demanded by the local church. We believe that AQuA can make possible the ideal of faster Scripture drafting, with an even higher quality finished product.","MTT who don’t speak English still found the interface intuitive enough to find and address problems.
Some teams report that AQuA helped save them years of work.
The team will further develop the AQuA backend to support integration into several bible translation platforms. This will facilitate the continued real world usage of this quality assessment technology. We will also explore and add new assessment techniques for use within AQuA.

With strong advocacy emanating from several organizations, including Biblica, we are on track to meet our 140 language project implementation goals by the end of 2024.  These translation teams are using AQuA to accelerate their translation work and improve quality.  Into 2025, this will continue to accelerate as AQuA becomes available through more platforms besides just our standalone web application and Clear Dashboard. 

According to many AQuA users, the various visualizations help to bring attention to outlier passages, reducing the burden on the reviewers.  This often saves significant amounts of time, and helps the team to produce higher quality work in the end. AQuA has also been improved following suggestions from users, who are in the best position to envision how the tool can help them increase the quality and speed of their work. Constructive feedback is improving the product, so that future users in Scripture Forge and Clear Dashboard (implementation being shifted to platform.bible) will have even more acceleration for their translations.","Ground work in the API connection has been addressed with Clear Bible and SIL Scripture Forge teams to allow usage tracking by API key.  This will allow negotiations with partner Bible Translation organizations for fair share support in the future to reduce ETEN funding for AQuA.

MAT is a much simpler tool. In working towards integration with the Scripture Engagement (SE) Guide, we have received input from some of the SE Guide team, including holding a joint MAT/SE Guide workshop after EMDC in June 2024, to understand how the two tools can work together. 

We are also holding a training event in Colombia in late July 2024 where training in the Language and Identity Journey and MAT will be given sequentially, with some time identifying how the tools differ and when each may be useful. We hope to learn from this, and plan for how the tools can work together for the good of the communities that use them.

MAT has been used within SIL, PBT, UBS, LBT, Seed Company, and is an intrinsic part of some Global Partnerships projects, as well as in many national organizations. We hope to strengthen these networks and support as many organizations as possible in its use.

The MAT is designed to address two other common issues - 1) identifying people that still need Scripture in their local language (“Bibleless peoples”), and 2) the less obvious problem of “Peopleless Bibles” (Bibles that don’t get used).

The MAT can help the community and partners to help identify cases where there is a strong need for Bible translation, and other places where a Bible translation is very unlikely to be used. 
The MAT itself has two major components. The first is a typology assessment where the community members answer 14 questions to discover their broad ‘type’ of multilingualism, and this information is then used to look at what sort of translation goals most often match their type. This also gives us important information on how vital the language is, and how widespread the use of other languages in the community is. 

The second stage is a facilitated discussion of what the type of multilingualism might imply for the community’s need for Scripture materials in their local language, and which formats will be the most useful (written, story, recording, song etc). 

MAT information website : https://sites.google.com/sil.org/mat/home?authuser=0","The key problem is that in many places, decisions about whether to translate are made without proper information or reflection on whether the Bible translation is needed and how it will be used. This lack of reflection can occur among the partnering organizations, and also within the community. A big part of this is not considering what roles different languages play within the lives of the community, and how that will impact the use of Scripture in the most local language; it is quite possible for translation programs to proceed without a plan for how the portions will in fact be used. We are not just interested in access, but ultimately in impact, so this should concern us. 

One of the biggest problems that occurs with translation is that communities are often highly motivated to do something about materials in their language once the language is already being lost. But a Bible translation in these circumstances tends not to be used, and does not influence what the next generation does with either their language or Scripture produced in it - such materials largely stay on the shelf. Use of the MAT should help everyone identify where this might be the case, and help prioritize translation efforts in places where need is higher, and use is more probable.","The MAT assists communities to appreciate the impact of their use of different languages in a way that then links to plans for Bible translation. It helps them to see the situation of their language and likely use of Scripture more clearly, and therefore to make better informed decisions, and we hope that because of their increased involvement in planning, it will also result in higher levels of engagement with Scripture. 

It enables better-informed translation decisions by communities and the partners that work with them, without needing highly-trained specialists to do an abstract analysis. It also helps the communities to plan how they will use Scripture products. A short training event can equip people in any country to successfully carry out an initial MAT conversation, which in our experience leads to more informed decision-making about an appropriate translation response. 

We also have seen that the tool can help identify whether the true desire of the community is Scripture than they can use, or whether the primary purpose of the translation is to preserve the language in some way. It is common for both these hopes to exist side by side, and it can be a long process to untangle the motivations, and help focus on meaningful engagement with Scripture. This conversation needs a highly-skilled facilitator.",,"It will help establish where many (with proper roll-out, hundreds, if not thousands) of languages are in relation to the All Access Goals, thus enabling better progress, and monitoring, towards those goals. It will also help communities evaluate if they need translation, and if so, what, and how to use it. 

The data gathered from the use of the MAT will be of much better quality than a ‘best guess’ approach, as it involves participation of community members. At the same time, it is probably not as accurate as a full survey, but takes much less time, and does not need a team who have spent several months being trained. It may, given proper roll-out, prove to be revolutionary in informing community decisions around translation. That data can then be communicated to ProgressBible, in order to update the All Access Goals on whether there is a need for translation, and what the nature and form of that need is, as well as identifying cases where it seems that there is no need.","We have already seen that SIL has put significant resources into MAT during 2024 (around $250,000). We also know that Seed Company has agreed to fund some MAT roll-out in Nepal, and that Global Partnerships have been funding its use in the Americas. As time goes by, we hope that the need for training workshops will decrease, as people who have been trained train others. The development of online training will also reduce costs. 

MAT itself is very cheap to implement, consisting of an exercise that should normally take less than a day - as such it can be built into other activities, such as translation checks and training seminars, and not involve major travel costs.",7012G0000012NMNQA2,Translation Tools

Paratext simplifies and supports the process of translating the Bible into various languages, making it an essential tool for Bible translators worldwide. Paratext supports collaboration by allowing multiple translators to work together on the same project, even if they’re in different locations, ensuring consistency and high quality. Paratext integrates with other translation tools and resources, which aids translators in keeping track of their work while making informed decisions, it also tracks the progress of the translation, helping teams stay on schedule and meet their goals. The design and development of Paratext is driven by feedback from users and teams so that Paratext can best serve the needs of translation teams. Paratext requires three core components to function. The Paratext software, the Paratext Registry (also used by DBL, Rev79, ProgressBible, Scripture Forge, and organizational tracking tools) and the Paratext servers are vital for storing and accessing the translation project data. The new Paratext 10 Studio, paves the way for new types of collaborations with other Bible translation organizations. This transition will enhance the tools and platforms available to translation teams, support the better integration of tools, and grow the network of partners involved in tool development for the Bible Translation movement.","The Bible translation process is a set of complex and detail-oriented tasks. People, teams and organizations working on Bible translation need good tools to do it well. With the help of computer and network technologies, we would like to remove unnecessary obstacles in translators’ work, provide necessary information and assistance, increase the translation team's productivity and effectiveness, improve the quality of work, help organizations track the progress of their project goals, and make the results of translators’ work available to target audiences quickly and efficiently. For Paratext to remain a key asset in the BT movement, it must operate on robust servers and be supported by a strong maintenance schedule with user-centric updates. The rapid development of new technologies, particularly AI, presents a challenge as translators struggle to keep up with those opportunities. To streamline access to many of the upcoming tools that are in development, Paratext needs to evolve into a more open platform that will allow many partners to create content, extensions, and integrated tools for their teams.  This platform is in development and is known as platform.bible on which Paratext 10 Studio is being built. The term ‘studio’ emphasizes the concept that there are multiple tools available on one platform while the open-course nature of the platform facilitates the creation of extensions, new tools and features, leveraging the appropriate servers and Registry systems.","Paratext is a user-friendly tool that facilitates real-time communication, efficient data sharing and seamless integration of AI technologies across platforms. Improving these aspects will enhance collaboration, accuracy, and efficiency in Bible translation projects, ultimately leading to higher-quality translations and broader accessibility._x000D_
Paratext is focused on being a tool that facilitates rich collaboration among often dispersed translation team members. A major development effort towards the use of the platform.bible open development platform, which will host a wide variety of extensions and modules developed by technologists across the Bible translation community, will enable Paratext to be more agile. When Paratext functions as part of an ecosystem of tools that work seamlessly together, such as those providing translation resources to user communities like the Digital Bible Library and Aquifer, it will deliver added value to the users and to language communities. This integration will enhance both the speed and accuracy of translation work and foster shared learning among translation teams and organizations. Ultimately, this approach will significantly advance our goal of achieving the transformational impact we all aspire to see.","There are a few other translation tools but not quite like Paratext: Render/Audio Project Manager / AVTT for OBT and translationCore from unfoldingWord.

This product provides a comprehensive and robust editing environment for first translations, revisions and study Bibles.  Paratext supports the value chain from exegesis, first draft, editing, and quality assurance, through to publication.  Updating Paratext to reflect the ways teams work together and opening the platform to enable better integration of new AI tools will increase the speed at which any team can produce high-quality translations.   _x000D_

Through extensive data curation, analysis and insights, ProgressBible prevents duplication of work and provides a comprehensive view of progress towards translation goals like the All Access Goals and other key metrics for the Bible Translation community.

The platform utilizes crowdsourcing methods and user-friendly data entry forms to collect information from a wide range of Great Commission organizations around the world. This data is then processed, studied, and analyzed to generate valuable insights that inform strategic decision-making for translation organizations, ministries and other stakeholders at national, regional and global levels.  

ProgressBible provides data integration options allowing organizations to embed the data into their own systems. It has become a foundational resource, made possible through a high level of collaboration and the continued support of partners like ETEN. ProgressBible meets both strategic and operational data needs related to Bible translation efforts globally by delivering an unprecedented level of data access, analysis and insights on this critical mission work.","Organizations working on Bible translation initiatives to achieve the All Access Goals face a significant problem - a lack of comprehensive data and information. Without access to robust, centralized data, these organizations struggle to effectively accelerate translation efforts, prevent duplication of work across multiple groups, and strategically allocate resources to the language communities with the greatest translation needs. This absence of critical information impedes their ability to make informed decisions and coordinate efforts, ultimately hindering progress towards increasing access to Scripture worldwide.","ProgressBible seeks to address the described need by:
Preventing duplication of efforts through comprehensive data curation and analysis.
Providing insights on the trajectory of All Access Goals (AAGs) and other areas of interest for the Bible Translation community.
Offering crowdsourcing data collection methods via a variety of user-friendly data entry forms.
Curating and analyzing data from Great Commission organizations to generate insights on the status of Bible translation needs worldwide.
Processing, studying, and analyzing entrusted data to inform strategic decision-making for Great Commission organizations and stakeholders.
Providing customizable data integration options for organizations to embed in their own systems.
Serving tactical, operational, and strategic decision-makers at national, regional, and global levels, with a focus on global-level organizations.
Supporting Rev79's Language Planning tool by managing its data requirements.
Supporting the broader Bible Translation community that utilizes Rev79 by leading the Rev79 Global Relationship Management team.",,"Prevent duplication of efforts, highlight areas of greatest needs, instigate collaboration

The LP Tools are integrated with ProgressBible and can optionally be used together with Rev79’s Project Management Tools.  Rev79 provides custom-built and field-centered tools for the Bible translation movement.","The pace of starting new Bible translation projects has accelerated, with a radically widened circle of partners.  This leads to a risk of confusion about who is working where, potential duplication of effort, as well as a risk that, amidst all the effort, strategic gaps may still be missed.  Furthermore, with so many projects in progress, there is a risk of unused translations.  National collaborators need a system that allows for field editing and configuration in line with their strategic plans, but that is integrated with curated global data systems (ProgressBible).","During 2025 we will:_x000D_

Currently we receive $340,000 per year in these contributions outside of ETEN’s contribution.  We call this our “Sustainability Budget”.  _x000D_
